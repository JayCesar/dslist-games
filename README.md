## ðŸ“Œ About

**DSList games** is a backend application developed during DevSuperior Week - an event organized by <b> <a href="https://github.com/devsuperior">DevSuperior.</a></b> 

It allows the user - once in the front-end - to be able to position the games in a list - by clicking and dragging - which is the main logic.

The system follows the Rest **API pattern** and handles **HTTP/REST requests** via **Get** and Post **methods**.

In practice, DsList games sends and handles game information through the use of Spring tools, SQL and databases - H2 (for testing) and Postgressql (for cloud application);

The data transaction takes place in three layers:

 **1) Rest + DTO controllers:** Data Transfer Objects - the "backend gateway" - it makes the **API available.**

 **2) Service Layer:** Where the business logic implementation takes place;

 **3) Data access layer:** mediated by entities and ORM (Object Relational Mapping).
